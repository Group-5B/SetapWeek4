## Interview

**Should the user not be able to listen to any music but only the weather suggested music from the app?**

Would you find it useful to receive notifications or suggestions based on changing weather conditions?

Sammy: not all people listen to all types of music? foe example, a person who likes metal might not like jazz. do you HAVE to listen to the music that is played or can you choose the genres you wanna listen to and the music would be filtered accordingly?
